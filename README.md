# Pig-Game
Created an interactive Pig Game where two players roll dice to score 10 points. 
Key features include:
Dice Rolling: Simulates dice rolls using a random number generator and displays the result with dice images.
Player Interaction: Players take turns rolling and accumulating points. If a player rolls a 1, their turn ends.
Score Tracking: Displays the current and total scores for both players.
Game Reset: A "New Game" button resets the game state.
Winner Declaration: Declares a winner when a player reaches 10 points.
